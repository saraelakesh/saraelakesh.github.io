## Background Information
I started my undergraduate career at UC Riverside as a Biology major with the hope to pursue optometry. After failing Biology twice, I decided to switch my major to Applied Math and everything else was history! I am currently working towards my Masters in Applied Math at Cal Poly Pomona, but am unsure of what I want to study.
